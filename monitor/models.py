TODO: 
  improve upon all other status nodes out there by providing a 
  time series database that displays reliability and growth of the node network. 
  REMEMBER: NO DATA IS USELESS, NO ONE CAN SAY SHIT AS LONG AS ITS PROPERLY LABELED
  ITS UP TO THEM TO FIGURE OUT A USE FOR IT. I AM JUST THE DATASOURCE. 
  
INTERVAL:
    Periodic complex RPC calls to node could cause unnessary slowdowns. 
    Dont worry about it until it becomes a problem. 
    Options:
    1 Minute interval -> May be a bit much. 
    5 Minute interval -> Should be low in resources.
